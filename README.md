# Edu Connect

Github link: https://github.com/gayathri-ch06/Edu-connect

## Description 
In this project, we provide a platform that gives students access to a
range of classes and educational materials. The same platform allows
instructors to set up and manage courses, track student development, and
provide help and feedback. Students can interact with one another on the
platform's discussion boards.

## Procedure

This is based on socket programming where the client is connected to the server.\
First we clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gayathri-ch06/Edu-connect
```
Here we first need to install the required modules from the _requirements.txt_
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After all the dependencies are met we navigate to the path of the server file and execute it by 

```bash
cd /educonnect/server
python ./server.py
```
Then we start the application 
```bash
cd /educonnect/
python ./start.py
```
